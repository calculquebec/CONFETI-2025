# CONFETI-2025
# MonarQ Live Demo: Run Your Quantum Circuit!  

Welcome to the **MonarQ Live Demo** repository! This is your chance to run your quantum circuits on **MonarQ**, Calcul Québec's quantum computer during the CONFETI poster session.  

## How It Works  

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Use the provided template file (`template_code.ipynb`) as a starting point for your PennyLane circuit.  
3. Once your code is ready, commit and push your file to this repository before **Wednesday, January 14th, at 1:00 PM**.  
4. Come visit us at the **Calcul Québec booth** to see your code in action on MonarQ!  

## Submission Guidelines  

- Name your file with your GitHub username to avoid conflicts (e.g., `username_circuit.ipynb`).  
- Ensure your code follows the structure in the template file. Only PennyLane code will be accepted. 
- You have access to 12 qubits.
- The max circuit depth is ~350 using single qubit gates and ~115 using two qubit gates.
- Calcul Québec reserves the right not to run all submitted circuits.

## Template Code  

We’ve provided a file called `template_code.ipynb` to help you get started. It includes the basic setup for running quantum circuits with PennyLane. Feel free to modify it to create your own unique circuit!
